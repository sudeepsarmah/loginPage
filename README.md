## Future Features to be added
1. *Username validity* - Just like the password, the Username value should also meet certain reuirements for the User to be able to submit the form
2. *Live Validation* - Instead of validation of the username and password **AFTER** the User tries submitting the form, the User should get live feedback regarding the username and password validity
3. *See and unsee password* - There should be an option to either be able to view the password when the User is typing in the password.
